\section{Tests}
\label{sec:tests}
Several tests are run to ensure that the algorithm runs correctly. 
The two test presented in this section is a test of the computed \textit{find\_max} function to find the off diagonal element with the largest absolute value of a symmetric matrix and a comparison of the computed solution for a simple $2\times 2$ case.
In \chapref{chap:Results} the results gained for the one particle case using the computed Jacobi algorithm is furthermore compared to the known analytical solution.
